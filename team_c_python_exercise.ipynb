    "Example\n",
    "A $12.43 bill is paid for with a 20 dollar bill.\n",
    "\n",
    "The change due is $7.57 and the bills and coins needed are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1 - 5 dollar bill 2 - 1 dollar bills 2 - quarters 1 - nickel 2 - pennies\n",

    "Notes\n",
    "Consider how you will present options to the user\n",
    "Consider how you will ensure the fewest number of bills and coins are issued.\n",

    "Create an option to account for a lack of bills or coins\n",
